# workstationMgmt

Collection of PowerShell functions focused on managing workstations in an enterprise environemnt.
These were written as I learned so some of the first ones written may be a little clunky, but they got the job done for me.
Includes some scripts I found useful from here and there on the internet. Attribution is preservered when it was available.
